    <p>Currently I'm a full time student studying marketing, mainly focused on SEO. Some of my hobbies include: working out, cooking, reading, and hanging out with friends. With this class, I hope to better understand the coding languages for websites so I can apply it to my work I hope to do in the future.</p>
