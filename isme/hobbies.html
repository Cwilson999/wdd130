                <h2>Exercise</h2>
                <p>
                    One of my hobbies/interests is exercising, currently it is mostly just lifting though. Throughout my life, I had participated in a variety of sports. The amount of strength training varied per sport, but I remembered enjoying going to the gym to lift some weights. After highschool, I feel like I stopped working out as much but that time was eventually filled with other hobbies and interests of mine. But over the past year and a half, I found myself feeling sluggish and from that, a desire to work out again began to form once more. The beginning was a slow start, but soon I started to go to the gym with a few friends of mine and we were able to make the gym a part of our daily routine.
                </p>
                <p>So over the course of just over a year, I have been able to make it to the gym almost every day. I feel like doing this has benefitted multiple aspects of my life. The things I have noticed the most are that I have more daily energy, feel more committed to other goals, strengthen my relationships, boost in my own personal self image.</p>

                <h2>Cooking</h2>
                <p>
                    Another hobby of mine is cooking. Growing up, I didn't cook often, but my parents enjoyed a wide variety of foods which helped expose me to many flavors. But I'd say my cooking journey didn't really start until after graudating high school.
