                    This first picture is in Goshogawara, Japan. They have this special summer festival called tachineputa festival where they make these huge paper mache floats the parade around the city.

                    Unfortuneatly I wasn't around during the time of the official festival but many of my friends had the opportunity to witness it which was really cool to hear about. I was lucky enough to visit a few museums that held these huge floats though. In a different city though, I was able to experience a Japanese Summer festival which is something I might cover on another day.

                <p>
                    This picture comes from a time I recently was able to visit Yellowstone National Park. For the past few years I had wanted to visit the park, but due to tough schedules, I wasn't able to make it early enough to camp there.

                    When I was younger, I had visited once with my family and while I don't remember too much of what we did, I have a small collection of pictures of the experience that I thought were pretty cool. Amongst the things I remember were that we saw some cool wildlife, there was a bear high up in the mountains, we saw old faithful, and we hiked a few of the trails there.
